I'm a third-year master student in the School of Cyber Science and Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (*HUST*) advised by [Prof. Cai Fu](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/fucai/zh_CN/index.htm). I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree from the same university in 2023.
My research has focused on Software Testing and Security, particularly in **WebAssembly** and **Kernel**. Additionally, I am highly interested in the integration of existing AI technologies, including large language models and reinforcement learning, into software engineering and security research.

# NEWS
> **2025.03.20:** I will be joining [Prof. Shaohua Li](https://shao-hua-li.github.io/)'s group at The Chinese University of Hong Kong in the second half of the year.
