I'm Xiao Wu (Âê¥È™Å), a second year master student in the School of Cyber Science and Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (*HUST*) advised by [Prof. Cai Fu](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/fucai/zh_CN/index.htm). I earned my bachelor‚Äôs degree from the same university in 2023.

My research has focused on Software Testing and Security, particularly in **WebAssembly** and **Kernel**. Additionally, I am highly interested in the integration of existing AI technologies, including large language models and reinforcement learning, into software engineering and security research.
