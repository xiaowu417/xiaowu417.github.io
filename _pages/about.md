I'm Xiao Wu (Âê¥È™Å), a second-year master's student at the School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) advised by [Prof. Cai Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FK3_guAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Before that, I earned my bachelor's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2023. 

My research has focused on has focused on software testing and security, including **WebAssembly**, **Fuzzing**, and **Symbolic Execution**. Additionally, I am highly interested in the integration of existing AI technologies, including large language models and reinforcement learning, into software engineering and security research.
